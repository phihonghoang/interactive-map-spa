# Interactive Map SPA

A single-page application (SPA) prototype built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides an interactive map experience with different access levels for guest and admin users.

## Overview

This SPA consists of four main sections:

1. **Login Page** – Users can log in as either a guest or an admin.
2. **Main Page** – Displays an interactive map where all users can view real-world locations.
3. **Add Location Page** (Admin-only) – Allows admins to add real-world locations to the map, which will appear both on the map itself and in a list beside it.
4. **Delete Location Page** (Admin-only) – Enables admins to remove locations from the map and the location list.

## Features

- **Guest Access** – Guests can log in and view the interactive map, but they cannot add or delete locations.
- **Admin Access** – Admin users have full control, with the ability to add new locations to the map and delete existing ones.
- **Real-time Updates** – Locations added or removed by the admin are dynamically displayed on the map and in the address list.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Map Library**: [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) – used to render the interactive map and manage location markers.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
4. Run the index.html file in a browser to launch the application.
